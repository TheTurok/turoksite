            GAR PR is a ranking system and tournament results archive for Super Smash Brothers Melee tournaments created by gaR, a player currently living in the Norcal area. It is intended to be used by local and regional Smash communities to provide a point-based ranking for all players in the region. Most regional power rankings have historically been decided by a panel of players and only include a small subset of the player base (top 10, top 20, etc.). They are also updated fairly infrequently (a couple of times a year). GAR PR intends to provide a very frequently updated and objective ranking that allows all players to see how they stack up against the rest of their region, no matter what their skill level is.
