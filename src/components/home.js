          I graduated from Univeristy of California, San Diego 2017 with a B.S. Computer Science.
          My focus in software enginering is web development. I make websites using React.

          <br/><br/>

          My passion is to express my creativity because people are able to enjoy this experience.
          Visual art allowed me express myself through an object.
          Dancing lets me express myself through my body in every beat.
          And music let's my creativity flow through people's ears.
          I love computer science because I am able to create things and people are able to enjoy and experience my work.
          With web development, I believe I can express myself in all ways a human can desire.
